<h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p class="main-bio">Bethell is named after a street in Sydney, Tabrett Street, something that resulted when her parents disagreed on what to name her while still at the hospital (her mother wanted "Siobhan", and her father wanted "Murray").
    Her father went for a drive, saw the name of the street, and returned to the hospital to suggest it to her mother, who said, "Yes, that's it!".
